# ATC NLP

The Whisper model is a powerful tool for various machine learning tasks. This project focuses on fine-tuning the Whisper model to transcribe ATC audios.

The fine-tuning code is contained in the `FineTune/finetunewhisper.ipynb` notebook. Code for evaluating the base Whisper model and our fine-tuned model is located in the `Evaluate` folder.
